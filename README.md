Self check:
 
 TOTAL POINTS - _** 6 points**_

-----------
## __Evaluation criteria__

- [x] Cr.1: **1** - **authorization-service** is added to the repo, has correct **basicAuthorizer** lambda and correct **serverless.yaml** file
- [x] Cr.2: **3** - **import-service** serverless.yaml file has authorizer configuration for the **importProductsFile** lambda. Request to the **importProductsFile** lambda should work only with correct **authorization_token** being decoded and checked by **basicAuthorizer** lambda. Response should be in 403 HTTP status if access is denied for this user (invalid **authorization_token**) and in 401 HTTP status if Authorization header is not provided.
- [x] Cr.3: **5** - update client application to send Authorization: Basic **authorization_token** header on import. Client should get **authorization_token** value from browser localStorage


## __Additional (optional) tasks__

- [x] Ad.1: **+1** - Client application should display alerts for the responses in 401 and 403 HTTP statuses. This behavior should be added to the **nodejs-aws-fe-main/src/index.tsx** file

## Screenshots 

## __FrontEnd__

```
The data in the FE is displayed from the API, which in turn takes it from the RDS AWS database.
Pictures are stored in a specially created S3 Bucket. CloudFront is configured for it.
Next to the price of each product, the remaining stock (stock) is displayed.

Implemented in the admin:
- displays a list of products
- uploading a CSV file with a list of products to the backet (to a specially created S3 Bucket).

```

* FrontEnd integrated with product service HTTP API & images from S3 Bucket: https://d2ufhlxk3moxcg.cloudfront.net

## __BackEnd__

```
Task-7 implements:


* during deployment, S3 Bucket **task-5-csv-uploaded** is automatically created and Ð¡ors and Policy are automatically assigned to it.
* during deployment, an SQS queue **catalogItemsQueue** is automatically created, which is a trigger for a lambda **catalogBatchProcess**
* lambda **importFileParser**, upload csv file to S3 Bucket **task-5-csv-uploaded** and send messages in SQS queue **catalogItemsQueue**
* * during deployment, a lambda **catalogBatchProcess** is automatically created, which receives messages from the SQS queue **catalogItemsQueue** up to 5 pieces at a time and stores them in the database
* during deployment, an SNS queue **catalogItemsQueue** is automatically created, which sends messages to e-mail when parsing goods from csv, while messages are sorted by price. The price is 500$
* after loading the csv file, records are created in the database
* **catalogBatchProcess** is in the **product-service** service

```
# Steps to deploy:

0. confug product-service in .env
1. cd product-service
2. serverless deploy 
3. In AWS Console open SQS Service and copy SQS_ARN and SQS_URL for import-service

5. cd import-service
6. serverless deploy
