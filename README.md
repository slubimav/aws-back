## __FrontEnd__

```
The data in the FE is displayed from the API, which in turn takes it from the RDS AWS database.
Pictures are stored in a specially created S3 Bucket. CloudFront is configured for it.
Next to the price of each product, the remaining stock (stock) is displayed.

Implemented in the admin:
- displays a list of products
- uploading a CSV file with a list of products to the backet (to a specially created S3 Bucket).

```

* FrontEnd integrated with product service HTTP API & images from S3 Bucket: https://d2ufhlxk3moxcg.cloudfront.net

## __BackEnd__

```
Task-6 implements:


* during deployment, S3 Bucket **task-5-csv-uploaded** is automatically created and Ð¡ors and Policy are automatically assigned to it.
* during deployment, an SQS queue **catalogItemsQueue** is automatically created, which is a trigger for a lambda **catalogBatchProcess**
* lambda **importFileParser**, upload csv file to S3 Bucket **task-5-csv-uploaded** and send messages in SQS queue **catalogItemsQueue**
* * during deployment, a lambda **catalogBatchProcess** is automatically created, which receives messages from the SQS queue **catalogItemsQueue** up to 5 pieces at a time and stores them in the database
* during deployment, an SNS queue **catalogItemsQueue** is automatically created, which sends messages to e-mail when parsing goods from csv, while messages are sorted by price. The price is 500$
* after loading the csv file, records are created in the database
* **catalogBatchProcess** is in the **product-service** service
